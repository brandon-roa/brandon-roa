Hello! I am Brandon Roa, a software engineer working with 100Devs. 

I am passionate about making people's lives easier, and one way I do so is by creating useful web interfaces from front to back. 

I live in San Diego, California and am interested in collaborating with people from all corners of the world. 
Please feel free to contact me if you're looking to work together or to discuss any ideas you may have!
